# tennis_project
In this project, we try to predict the issue of a tennis game with machine learing tools.



#  # TENNIS MATCH OUTCOME PREDICTION

#  In this notebook, we develop a model in order to predict the grand chelem tennis game outcome. 
# 
# During the model's training, we remained very careful about not corrupting our learnings with data from year 2018 to 2021. To do so, years 2018 to 2021 data remained untouched during our training/validation/analysis procedure.
# 
# Table of contents of our approach:
# 
# - **Data Preparation Process**:
#         - Data Checking & Cleaning 
#         - Randomization of dataset
#         - Categorical Encoding & Features Engineering
#         - Data Normalization 
# 
# - **Modeling Phase**:
#         - Training/Validation: Logistic Regression
#         - Training/Validation: Random Forest
#         - Training/Validation: Support Vector Machin
#         - Training/Validation: XGBoost
#         - Training/Evaluation: MLP Classifier
